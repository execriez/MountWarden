INSTALLATION:

Open the Terminal app, and download the latest MountWarden.pkg installer to your desktop by typing the following command. 

	curl -k --silent --retry 3 --retry-max-time 6 --fail https://raw.githubusercontent.com/execriez/MountWarden/master/SupportFiles/MountWarden.pkg

To install, double-click the downloaded package.

The installer will install the following files and directories:

	/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.mountwarden.plist
	/usr/MountWarden/
	/usr/MountWarden/bin/
	/usr/MountWarden/bin/MountWarden
	/usr/MountWarden/bin/MountWarden-DidMount
	/usr/MountWarden/bin/MountWarden-WillUnmount
	/usr/MountWarden/bin/MountWarden-DidUnmount

There's no need to reboot.

After installation, your computer will speak whenever a volume is mounted or unmounted. 

If the installer fails you should check the installation logs.


MODIFYING THE EXAMPLE SCRIPTS:

After installation, three simple example scripts can be found in the following location:

   /usr/MountWarden/bin/MountWarden-DidMount
   /usr/MountWarden/bin/MountWarden-WillUnmount
   /usr/MountWarden/bin/MountWarden-DidUnmount

These scripts simply write to the log file ~/Library/Logs/MountWarden.log whenever the ConsoleUser changes. Modify the scripts to your own needs.


LOGS:

The example scripts write to the following log file:

	~/Library/Logs/MountWarden.log

The installer writes to the following log file:

	/Library/Logs/com.github.execriez.mountwarden.log
  
You should check this log if there are issues when installing.
