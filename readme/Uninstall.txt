UNINSTALLING:

Download the MountWarden uninstaller package here:

   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/execriez/MountWarden/master/SupportFiles/MountWarden-Uninstaller.pkg

The uninstaller will remove the following files and directories:

   /Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.mountwarden.plist
   /usr/MountWarden/

After the uninstall everything goes back to normal, and volume mounting will not be tracked.

There's no need to reboot.
