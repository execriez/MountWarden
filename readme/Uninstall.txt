UNINSTALLING:

Open the Terminal app, and download the latest MountWarden-Uninstaller.pkg uninstaller to your desktop by typing the following command. 

	curl -k --silent --retry 3 --retry-max-time 6 --fail https://raw.githubusercontent.com/execriez/MountWarden/master/SupportFiles/MountWarden-Uninstaller.pkg --output ~/Desktop/ConsoleUserWarden-Uninstaller.pkg

To uninstall, double-click the downloaded package.

The uninstaller will remove the following files and directories:

	/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.mountwarden.plist
	/usr/MountWarden/

After the uninstall everything goes back to normal, and volume mounting will not be tracked.

There's no need to reboot.
